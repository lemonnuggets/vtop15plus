# vtop15plus

Chrome Extension to allow student to stay inactive on VTOP for longer than 15 minutes.

## Consider Before Using

The extension has been tested extensively and no negative effects were observed, but this may not be the case for the user.

User should realize that using this software makes their account less secure as it allows anyone to get on their device while they're signed in, and use their account.

It should also be understood that VIT could see this as suspicious behaviour and block their account though no such event has happened so far.
